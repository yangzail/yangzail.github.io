[^1]: You MAY open an issue on GitHub, but no response and/or fix is guaranteed.
      You understand that using Jekyll requires technical know-how and is not comparable to Wordpress in terms of ease of use. Please use the free version to confirm that Hydejack works for you. For details, see the [PRO] license.

[^2]: Actual page load speed depends on your hosting provider, resolution of embedded images and usage of 3rd party plugins.
